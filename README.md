This is my web browser calculator! It runs in all browsers and can chain multiple expressions.

This project was a fun one to build and took a lot of playing around with to get things working correctly. I learned some really important things during this project that I wanted to note.

1. I tackled this project visually to begin with and started with HTML and CSS to get the design working appropriately. This process went very smoothly and I was able to integrate the HTML and CSS together with almost no issues, which was a huge success. Getting things placed was hassle free, whereas with previous projects I had struggled to use flex, margin, padding, etc.

2. With JavaScript, I was ready and had the querySelectors and addEventListeners ready to go and already knew I was going to need them. I was happy that this step went so easily, because during the Etch-a-Sketch project it was difficult to tackle that task for the first time.

3. My biggest difficulties were getting the inputNumber and inputOperator functions and getting them to work simultaneously with the inputEquals and operate functions. It took a lot of console.loging and debuging in Google Chrome Dev Tools to figure out what variables weren't being sent, or getting deleted at a certain location, etc. Whenever I struggled with this project I'd take a break, study other student solutions to see how they tackled it and then would come back to my code and try to understand what wasn't working. Going back I think writing more psuedo-code and writing down the processes I want to tackle instead of visualizing it would've worked a lot better and saved some time.
